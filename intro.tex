Given a set of $n$ points in the plane, we consider the problem of embedding these points into a grid such that the density of the grid is maximal. This problem have an application in optimal sizing of wind-farms \cite{blablabla} where must first define, from a set a wind-farms, the neighborhood graph of this set. More precisely, given a set of point in the plane, we consider a first grid-embedding such that any two points are at least separated by one vertical line and one horizontal line. Then, we consider the problem of deciding which horizontal and vertical lines to remove such that the derived embedding maximize the density of the grid, i.e., the number of edges in the corresponding neighbor graph.\\
In section \ref{sec:problemdef}, we give a formal definition of the problem. In section \ref{sect:complexity}, we prove that the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete, then we give, in section \ref{sect:approx} some results about approximability of the problem. In section \ref{sec:linearprog} we derive an linear integer program for the model and run some experiments, then in the next section, we present and compare three different heuristics to solve the problem
