\section{Approximability}

In this section we define the notion of maximal feasible solution and prove that every algorithm returning a maximal feasible solution is a $\sqrt{n}$ approximation.

\begin{definition}
We say a feasible solution is \emph{maximal} if it is not strictly included in another feasible solution. In oher words, when all the lines and columns of that solution are contracted, it is not possible to contract any other line or column.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
\label{theo:bounds}
Let $M$ be an instance of MMC, $(I,J)$ a maximal feasible solution and $M' = C(M,I,J)$ then $2 \sqrt{n} \leq d(M') \leq 4n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
A 1 in a matrix cannot have more than $8$ neighbors, thus the density of $M'$ is no more than $4n$.

Let $2$ lines $i$ and $i+1$ of $M'$, there is a column $j$ such that $M'_{i,j} = M'_{i+1,j} = 1$ otherwise we could contract line $i$ and $(I,J)$ would not be maximal. Similarly for each column $j$. Thus $d(M') \geq p'+q'$ where $p'$ and $q'$ are respectively the number of lines and columns of $M'$.

\begin{align*}
\intertext{As $M'$ contains $n$ 1's,}
&& p'\cdot q' &\geq n\\
\intertext{We now show that $p'+q' \geq 2 \sqrt{n}$ by contradiction. We assume that}
&& p' + q' &< 2 \sqrt{n}\\
&\Rightarrow& p' \cdot q' &< 2\sqrt{n}p - p^2\\
\intertext{As the function $2\sqrt{n} x - x^2$ is decreasing if and only if $x \geq \sqrt{n}$ and then, the maximum is reached when $x = \sqrt{n}$}
&\Rightarrow& p' \cdot q' &< 2 \sqrt{n}^2 - \sqrt{n}^2 = n \\
\intertext{This is a contradiction as $p' \cdot q' \geq n$, thus}
&& d(M') &\geq p' + q' \geq 2 \sqrt{n}
\end{align*}

\end{proof}


\begin{corol}
An algorithm returning any maximal solution of an instance of MMC is a $2\sqrt{n}$-approximation.
\end{corol}

\begin{remark}
\label{rmk:badinstance}
There are instances such that the ratio between an optimal density and the density of the worst maximal solution is $\sqrt{n}$. An example is given in Figure~\ref{fig:badinstance}.
