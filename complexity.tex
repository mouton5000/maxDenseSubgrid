This section is dedicated to proving the NP-Completeness of the problem.

  \begin{theorem}
  \label{theo:complexity}
  The decision version of (MMC) is NP-Complete.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
 

    Lets $M$ be an instance of MMC. Given an integer $K$, a subset $I$ of $\llbracket 1; p-1 \rrbracket$ and a subset $J$ of $\llbracket 1; q-1 \rrbracket$, one can compute in polynomial time the matrix $C(M,I,J)$ and checks if $d(C(M,I,J)) \geq K$. This proves the problem belongs to NP.

    In order to prove the NP-Hardness, we describe a polynomial reduction from the Maximum Clique problem. Lets $G(V,E)$ be an instance of the Maximum Clique problem, we build an instance $M$ of MMC with $p = q = (4|V| + 6)$. We arbitrarily number the nodes of $G$ : $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots v_n\}$.

    Let $l_i$ and$c_i$ be respectively the $6+4(i-1)+1$-th line and the $6+4(i-1)+1$-th column. We associate the lines $l_i$ to $l_i+3$ and the columns $c_i$ to $c_i + 3$ to $v_i$. The key idea of the reduction is that each node $v$ is associated with two 1. If we chose the node $v$ to be in the clique, then, firstly, the two 1 it is associated with are moved next to each other and this increases the density by one; and secondly, for every node $w$ such that $(v,w) \not\in E$, the two 1 it is associated to cannot be moved anymore.

    We use three gadgets in this reduction, described in Figure~\ref{fig:reduction:gadgets}. The gadget $(\alpha_i)$ is added at the intersection of the lines and the columns associated with the node $v_i$. The gadget $(\beta_{i,j})$ is added at the intersection of the lines of $v_i$ and the columns of $v_j$ such that $(v_i,v_j) \not\in E$. If $v_i$ and $v_j$ are linked with an edge in $G$, there is no 1 at the intersections of the lines of $v_i$ and the column of $v_j$. We add the gadget $(\gamma_i)$ for each node $v_i$ at line 1, and a symetric gadget at column 1. Finally, we set $M_{1,j} = M_{j,1} = 1$ for each $j \in \llbracket 1;6 \rrbracket$. A complete example is given in Figure~\ref{fig:reduction:example}.

\end{figure}

The initial density in this matrix is $d_0 = 11 + 6|V| + (|V| (|V|-1) - 2|E|)$. Note that, firstly, only the lines $l_i$ and columns $c_i$ for $i \in \llbracket 1;n \rrbracket$ may be contracted and, secondly, we cannot increase the density of the 1's that are not contained in the gadgets $(a_i)$. In order to add one to the density of the matrix we must choose a node $v_i$ and contract the column $c_i$ and the line $l_i$. 

If the column $c_i$ is contracted and if $(v_i, v_j) \not \in E$, the two 1's of the gadget $(\beta_{i,j})$ are moved on the same column. Similarly, if the line $l_i$ is contracted, the two 1's of the gadget $(\beta_{j,i})$ are moved on the same column. This prohibits the contraction of the line $l_j$ and thecolumn $c_j$. Consequently, in order to add $C$ to the density, we must find a clique of size $C$ in the graph and contract every line and column associated with the nodes of that clique.

Thus, there is a clique of size $K$ if and only if there is a feasible solution for $M$ of density $d_0 + K$. This concludes the proof of NP-Completeness.

  \end{proof}
